# Retail Sales & Profit Insights

## [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/RetailSalesandProfitInsights/RetailSalesProfitInsights?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

### Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed retail sales data to extract key insights and calculate performance indicators (KPIs). My goal was to track sales trends, profit margins, and best-selling products, using SQL for data processing and Tableau for visualization.

### Tools & Implementation

1️⃣ ChatGPT
I used ChatGPT to generate ideas for relevant KPIs, SQL queries, and data visualizations. Additionally, the dataset itself was generated using ChatGPT, allowing me to work with a realistic and complex data set. ChatGPT also helped me improve the dataset structure and optimize queries for PostgreSQL.

2️⃣ SQL (PostgreSQL - DBeaver)
I created and populated the retail_sales_large database, calculated derived values (e.g., profit margin, discounted prices), and built views for aggregated analysis of monthly sales and profits.

3️⃣ Tableau
I developed an interactive dashboard to visualize sales and profit performance. The dashboard includes KPIs, geographic analysis, and sales distribution by product categories, providing data-driven decision support.

### Dashboard Visualizations

📌 KPIs Section: Displays key indicators—profit margin, total sales, and total profit.

📌 Map (City Filter): The map allows filtering of the entire dashboard based on selected cities.

📌 Pie Chart (Top-Selling Categories): Highlights product categories with the highest sales.

📌 Bar Chart (Sales & Profit Trends): Represents the monthly evolution of total sales and profit.

📌 Line Chart (Annual Profit): Compares yearly profit trends.

📌 Horizontal Bar Chart (Top-Selling Products): Shows the best-selling products.
