# RETAIL SALES & PROFIT INSIGHTS

![Retail Sales and Profit Insights ss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af3d428d-2437-42fd-a32f-af32640bcfbf)


## Project Overview

### In this project, I analyzed retail sales data to extract key insights and calculate performance indicators (KPIs). My goal was to track sales trends, profit margins, and best-selling products, using SQL for data processing and Tableau for visualization.

## Tools & Implementation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ ChatGPT

I used ChatGPT to generate ideas for relevant KPIs, SQL queries, and data visualizations. Additionally, the dataset itself was generated using ChatGPT, allowing me to work with a realistic and complex data set. ChatGPT also helped me improve the dataset structure and optimize queries for PostgreSQL.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ SQL (PostgreSQL - DBeaver)

I created and populated the retail_sales_large database, calculated derived values (e.g., profit margin, discounted prices), and built views for aggregated analysis of monthly sales and profits.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Tableau

I developed an interactive dashboard to visualize sales and profit performance. The dashboard includes KPIs, geographic analysis, and sales distribution by product categories, providing data-driven decision support.

## Conclusion

The dashboard reveals that Accessories dominate sales, contributing the highest percentage of total revenue. Additionally, sales and profit tend to peak in mid-year months, indicating a seasonal trend that could be leveraged for strategic planning. The profit margin remains stable at 20%, suggesting consistent pricing strategies. Finally, the geographic filter enables insights into regional performance, helping businesses tailor their strategies based on location-based sales performance.
